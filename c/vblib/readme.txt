VBlib - Visual Basic String Functions for C


VBlib contains C ports of the Visual Basic string manipulation functions.
Included are C versions of:

   len
   instr
   right
   left
   ltrim
   rtrim
   trim
   mid

Read the comments above each specific header for more information. Except
where noted, most functions can be used in a similar way to their VB
counterparts.

We've successfully compiled this on Windows 2000 and AIX 4.2. It should be
portable to any version of Unix or Windows.
