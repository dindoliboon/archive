   (one under another).

ver 2.5
 * Compiled with GNU gcc ver 2.95 for Mingw32. 

ver. 2.1-2.4 - not viable.

ver. 2.0
 * Compiled with Watcom C.
 - Dll stay in memory after exit
 - Incorrect closing
 + Menu for tray icons
   (+About box,
     restore,
     close,
     +kill the window trayed,
     +exit)

 * Remaked by Aleksey Novosiolov for Borland C builder.
 - System crash if traying win32 console windows.
 + Closing window by right-clicking on tray icon.
 + Tooltip updates when mouse moves over icon.
 ! Works incorrectly when closing programs what asks for closing

ver. 1.0
 * Written in VC 5.0, compiled with Watcom C/C++ v11.0 (for less size).
 * Only minimize windows in tray. Without menu.
 ! System crash if traying win32 console windows.
      Restoring trayed win32 console apps may hang the system.
      The point is not in RBTray but in Windows 95.
      If you ShowWindow with SW_MINIMIZE and the with SW_HIDE,
      after restoring win32 console app you'll always hang up Win95.
      Under WinNT works correctly.
