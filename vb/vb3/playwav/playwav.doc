Forum member Harmon Rogers helped me learn how to use sndPlaySound in VB.  
I find it interesting that every code example given by Microsoft declares 
the function in such a way that it WILL NOT allow you to stop the "SND_LOOP"
once it's been initiated. 

IE: Microsofts example code is:
Declare Function sndPlaySound Lib "MMSYSTEM.DLL" (ByVal lpszSoundName$
        ByVal wFlags%) As Integer                                    ^
                                           /-------------------------^
    Limiting the lpszSoundName to being a $ variable WILL NOT allow specifying
a NULL integer which is required to stop the SND_LOOP.  
    Neither "" or "NULL" or "0" or "0&" will work!
    WHAT'S NEEDED is to modify the declare line to read as follows:

Declare Function sndPlaySound Lib "MMSYSTEM.DLL" (ByVal lpszSoundName As Any
        ByVal wFlags%) As Integer                                     ^^^^^^

    NOW you can pass EITHER a filename $ to start playing, or a NULL INTEGER 
to stop the play. If for example you've placed the following constants in 
your global module:

Global Const SND_SYNC      = &H0000
Global Const SND_ASYNC     = &H0001
Global Const SND_NODEFAULT = &H0002
Global Const SND_LOOP      = &H0008
Global Const SND_NOSTOP    = &H0010

You might want to now add a NULL Definition line:

Global Const NULL = 0&            (Wonder what other No's would work?)

    You can now stop the SND_LOOP with the following line:
x% = sndPlaySound ( NULL, wFlags%)

     OK, you say, stop what?  How do you start the loop going anyway?
     The Microsoft article ID No. Q86281 entitled:
     "How to Play a Waveform (.WAV) Sound File in Visual Basic" says
you can put 2 wFlags% together in VB with an "And" operator.  Truth is,
you can't!  What must be used in Visual Basic is the Plus sign: "+"
     
     For example, to start the file playing:
x% = sndPlaySound ("RING.WAV", SND_LOOP + SND_ASYNC)
     
     The following line WON'T WORK, even though the article says it will.
x% = sndPlaySound ("Ring.Wav", SND_LOOP And SND_ASYNC)  

     I've searched all the SPI, SDK & Multimedia help files I have, for
Win 3.0, 3.1, and the preleminary 3.2 files, AS WELL as the new 
"Developers Net CD-ROM", and all the code examples are incorrect for usage
in Visual Basic regarding starting & stopping SND_LOOP.

     Am I correct in assuming that Microsoft expects us all to know "C"
syntax, and the difference between it and Visual Basic Syntax?  How do you 
like the idea of suggesting to Microsoft that each article should state what
language the syntax belongs to, or to write an article for Visual Basic users
that explains the syntax differences so they could figgure 'em out for 
themselves, or MAYBE give examples of BOTH syntaxes in each article?

     Of course if such articles already exist, maybe their existance 
should be more widely exposed...

     In an effort to help others with what we've been discussing, I'm 
uploading a MAKfile VB-project called "PLAYWAV.ZIP" to the MSBASIC-VB forum.
Keywords will be: MSGBOX MESSAGE sndPlaySound SND_LOOP WAV.
Sound good?
Let me know of anything wrong with the above, since I want to include it too.
Look for it by the end of the week.

P.S. I like your idea of replacing:
"lpxSoundName" with "FileName".
It's much less cryptic!
