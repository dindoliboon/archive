The code in this project was found in the Microsoft Visual Basic
Knowledge Base Article Q112649 and is commented in many areas (both
by MS and by me.)

Ivan (IvanSkii) uploaded IVY Spy a couple of years ago. I got a lot
of *great* use out of it. In a chat I had with him, he pointed me to the 
VBKB he used to create it. I played with this code and started using it 
with the StayOnTop and center form code. It's very handy for me. If you 
do much programming using API calls, I think you'll find it helpful, too.

The primary difference you'll find between FreeSpy and IVYSpy is code
which will automatically center the form on startup, and I added a
StayOnTop function -- one that will work even *after* the window has
been minimized and then maximized again.

Go through the project files and play with it. Also, make sure you get
the latest Microsoft Visual Basic Knowledge Base (16-bit, 32-bit or both.)
There's a TON of great stuff in there!
