Monitor with a VGA graphics system, MS-DOS version 5.0 or higher and Windows 3.1 or higher.  
You will also need the run time version of Visual Basic 3 (VBRUN300.DLL). If you
do not have this file then in can be downloaded seperately from Compuserve in one of many 
different forums. Contact the Sysop for more detail.

3. FILE LIST
Files that should be in the directory you create.
SETTIME.EXE		The main program

4. HOW TO USE THE PROGRAM
The program is very simple to work out, but here are a few instructions anyway.  Using the drive, directory 
and file list boxes, choose the directory where you want to set the file date and times of files.
Then select 1 or more files to set the date and time of (if neccessary use the File Types filter to make it easier.
Enter the Date and Time that you want the files set to in the boxes in the top right corner and press Start.
*** NOTE *** You cannot set the time to a time that ends with an odd digit (e.g. 12:30:37) - strange but true !!
